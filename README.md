# Graph Algorithms

C++ implementations of various graph algorithms such as: Traversals (BFS, DFS), Topological Sort, Shortest Path, and Minimum Spanning Trees.

## Purpose

Understanding an algorithm can sometimes be quite difficult. I believe that in order to completely understand an algorithm, one would have to implement the algorithm himself. I have uploaded my implementations of these various graph algorithms and I have included a lot of comments, so the code is quite self explanatory. This repository is also intended to help students in ECS 60 (Data Structures and Programming - UC Davis).

### Graph Algorithms Implemented

* Breadth First Search (BFS): Time Complexity - *O(|V| + |E|)*
* Depth First Search (DFS): Time Complexity - *O(|V| + |E|)*
* Topological Sort: Time Complexity - *O(|V| + |E|)*
* Unweighted, Undirected Graph Shortest Path: Time Complexity - *O(|V| + |E|)*
* Dijkstra's Algorithm: Time Complexity - *O(|V| + |E|log|V|)* {Implemented using a min priority queue}
* Prim's Algorithm (MST): Time Complexity - *O((|V| + |E|)log|V|)*
